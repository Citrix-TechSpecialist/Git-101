# Git-101: An Introduction to Git using SourceTree

## Module 4: Branching, Merging, and Reverting

In this module we will explain and show you the importance of being able to branch, merge, and revert your current state of your repository.

The basic GIT workflow is as follows: Create repository -> create or copy over files -> stage them to be saved at their current state -> commit them -> share the commit with your team -> **work on new ideas or sections of the project -> merge them back with the original branch -> repeat**.

### Branching

In this tutorial we will use SourceTree to graphically create a new repository within GitHub and preform some initial configuration.
