# Git-101: An Introduction to Git using SourceTree

## Module 1: Create a new Repository

In this module we will create a new repository which will allow you to track your changes to files within.  This is the first required step for any new project within GitHub. A git repository allows you to easily collaborate with a team and work simultaneously on these files. Git's special sauce is that it allows you to merge changes of files that have been worked on from many contributors together very easily, typically automatically. *It is important to know that Git works to it's best potential with flat text files, IE) Word .docx files will not work as well as a standard text file.*

The basic GIT workflow is as follows: **Create repository** -> create or copy over files -> stage them to be saved at their current state -> commit them -> share the commit with your team -> work on new ideas or sections of the project -> merge them back with the original branch -> repeat.

### Create a new Repository

In this tutorial we will use SourceTree to graphically create a new repository within GitHub and preform some initial configuration.

1. Within SourceTree click on the Create button in the top menu.
1. Choose your destination path to store your Git repositories on your local machine by clicking Browse.  You can see I choose my Downloads directory.
1. Name your repository by adding `\git-101` to the end of the destination path.
1. Verify that your GitHub account is selected below Repository Settings to store this repository on GitHub.
1. Key in a description for the repository such as `This is the repo for Git-101`.
1. Click Create. During this process your repository will be created locally and on GitHub.
1. If asked enter Your Full Name and Your Email address. These will be used to author commits with your information. We will discuss commits in a later module.
